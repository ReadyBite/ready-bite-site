        <h2>About Ready Bite</h2>
        <p>At Ready Bite, we’re more than just a meal prep service—we’re three friends who share a passion for fitness, healthy living, great food, and helping others. What started as a simple idea—cooking meals for ourselves and those around us—quickly grew into something bigger. We saw a real need in our community for affordable, high-quality, and genuinely delicious meal prep, and we decided to make it happen.</p>
        <p>Too many meal prep services have raised prices, cut corners on ingredients, and forgotten about the customer experience. That’s not us. We’re committed to using quality ingredients, keeping our meals affordable, and making sure every customer feels valued.</p>
        <p>Each week, we prepare fresh, flavorful meals and deliver them straight to your door—no hassle, no guesswork, just great food that fits your lifestyle. Whether you're focused on fitness, convenience, or simply eating better, we’re here to make it easy.</p>
        <p>We may be a new company, but we’re putting in the work to grow the right way—through quality, consistency, and customer trust. Our goal isn’t just to sell meals; it’s to build a brand people can rely on for great food and an even better experience.</p>
        <p>Thanks for supporting us on this journey. We can’t wait to serve you!</p>
